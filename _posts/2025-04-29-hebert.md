####  Introduction

In December 2024, the government of Bashar Al-Assad collapsed amid a sudden and unexpected advance of anti-government forces. After years of near-frozen conflict, anti-government forces managed to capture Aleppo with little resistance, with many analysts speculating that cities like Daraa and Hama could be next. Yet few outside observers predicted this offensive would lead to the immediate collapse of the regime. 

Due to the unexpected nature of these events, many international news agencies were slow to notice their significance. By December 1, Syrian rebel advances were peripherally mentioned in coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza. Still, it was only on December 6th, after the city of Homs was captured from the Assad regime, that major agencies began dedicated coverage of Syria. 

This project analyzes the journalistic methods used to rapidly cover the fall of the Assad regime and the city of Damascus. I wish to examine the reliance of reporting on various forms of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), and on constructing an authoritative voice amid uncertainty “on the ground.”

#### OSINT and the Analysis Industry

Journalism under the Assad regime was heavily regulated. All Syrian journalists had to be licensed with the state news agency, and international correspondents were prohibited from entering the country. These obstacles led to an emphasized use of OSINT in Syria coverage. With the competing pressures of the need for accuracy and the desire to break stories first, mainstream news agencies heavily utilized open-source methods in their reporting.  

For example, even though Reuters, the Associated Press, and Agence-France Presse manage their own well-respected wires to other newsrooms, all three relied on regime-run television, anonymous Syrian contacts, and social media channels—in other words, the same sources as any freelance investigative journalist.

There is a tension observable in the coverage of the events in Syria. Journalists have a responsibility to vet sources of information “on the ground” before reporting on them, but they are also pressed to cover the news “as it happens”, in an immediate and timely manner. In a context like Syria, the desire to cover these extraordinary events competes with journalistic responsibility to ground-truth what one is reporting. As this is impossible in such circumstances, a kind of metaphorical ground-truthing has to occur; rather than establish facts on the ground, agencies have created “verification teams”,  such as BBC Verify, Al Jazeera’s Sanad Verification Agency, and New York Times’ Visual Investigations. These teams sift through OSINT to find appropriate
