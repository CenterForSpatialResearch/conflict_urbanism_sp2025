####  Introduction

In December 2024, the government of Bashar Al-Assad collapsed amid a sudden and unexpected advancement of anti-government forces. After years of near-frozen conflict, anti-government forces managed to capture Aleppo with little resistance, with many analysts speculating that cities like Daraa and Hama could be next. Yet few outside observers predicted this offensive would lead to the immediate collapse of the regime. 

Many international news agencies were slow to pick up the developments in Syria. Syrian rebel advances were peripherally mentioned in coverage of the war in Gaza, but it was only on December 6th, after Homs was captured from the Assad regime, that most agencies began dedicated coverage of Syria.
