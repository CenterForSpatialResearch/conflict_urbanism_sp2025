####  Introduction

In December 2024, the government of Bashar Al-Assad collapsed amid a sudden and unexpected advance of anti-government forces. After years of near-frozen conflict, anti-government forces managed to capture Aleppo with little resistance, with many analysts speculating that cities like Daraa and Hama could be next. Yet few outside observers predicted this offensive would lead to the immediate collapse of the regime. 

Due to the unexpected nature of these events, many international news agencies were slow to notice their significance. By December 1, Syrian rebel advances were peripherally mentioned in coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza. Still, it was only on December 6th, after the city of Homs was captured from the Assad regime, that major agencies began dedicated coverage of Syria. 

This project analyzes the journalistic methods used to rapidly cover the fall of the Assad regime and the city of Damascus. I wish to examine the reliance of reporting on various forms of OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence), and on constructing an authoritative voice amid uncertainty “on the ground.”
