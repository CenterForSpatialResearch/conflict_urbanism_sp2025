The project explores the impact of nuclear power plant infrastructure on maritime ecosystems and how these artificial landscapes can unintentionally create ideal habitats for wildlife. Set against a backdrop of critical concerns for the risk associated with nuclear generation, our research aims to bring to light the nuanced effects of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, located in the Miami area, Florida, on both the health of the local ecosystem, and focuses in on the impact on two specific species: American crocodiles and seagrass. 



#### CROCODILES


#### ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT



#### CENSUS

(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
