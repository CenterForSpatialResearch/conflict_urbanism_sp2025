The project explores the impact of nuclear power plant infrastructure on maritime ecosystems and how these artificial landscapes can unintentionally create ideal habitats for wildlife. Set against a backdrop of critical concerns for the risk associated with nuclear generation, our research aims to bring to light the nuanced effects of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station, located in the Miami area, Florida, on both the health of the local ecosystem, and focuses in on the impact on two specific species: American crocodiles and seagrass.
