title:  "Nuclear Ecology: Data Voids of Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station"
author: "Holly Baker, Minhan Lin, Trella Isabel Lopez"
---

The project explores the impact of Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station on ecosystems – both natural and political – in Southern Florida. Tracing how nuclear infrastructure creates an artificial landscape, our project reveals a key tension: while Turkey Point’s cooling canals have been long under scrutiny by environmental groups due to their proven leaking of salt water into local aquifers, this warm brackish water has surprisingly created an ideal habitat for American crocodiles. Set against a backdrop of concerns for the risk associated with nuclear generation, our research aims to bring to light the various data voids – or missing information – connected to Turkey Point. Amidst a contentious political landscape with scandals connected to Florida Power & Light, the owner of the plant, the project focuses on mapping available information and the array of actors, from Senators to crocodiles, to point to gaps in Turkey Point’s narrative. The research aims to expose a series of complex relationships between ecology and political motivations and, ultimately, contribute a nuanced perspective to discourse on impact of nuclear infrastructure.

Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station was completed in 1972 to meet the energy demands of South Florida’s booming population, under the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. Located twenty five miles south of Miami, the plant sits in a sensitive ecosystem between the Everglades National Park and Biscayne Bay. It sits directly on top of the Biscayne Aquifer, the primary public water supply for Miami-Dade and Florida Keys. The plant is owned by Florida Power & Light Co (FPL), and comprises seven units: units 1, 2 and 5 are oil/gas, whilst units 3 and 4 are nuclear generating. With units 6 and 7 in construction, our investigation focuses specifically on units 3 and 4. The Turkey Point cooling canals span 168 linear miles, an area so large that it can be seen from space or zoom level 1, and stands as the only plant in the US that uses earthen cooling canals in its operations. After a contentious exchange involving multiple lawsuits between FPL and environmental groups, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved and reinstates Turkey Point’s license extensions in March 2024, allowing Units 3 and 4 to operate until 2052 and 2053 respectively.

Turkey Point has since become a thriving sanctuary for American crocodiles, a species once on the brink of extinction. South Florida’s crocodile population was estimated to have numbered over 3000 in the early 1960s, but their population had dwindled to just 150-300 by the mid-1970s and were classified as an endangered species. Reasons for the historical decline of its population in North America include habitat loss, road kills, hunting for the hide industry, pet trade, and wildlife exhibitions. The construction of Turkey Point’s cooling canals had inadvertently created a near-perfect habitat for these crocodiles. These canals serve an essential engineering purpose: as water cycles through the nuclear plant, it removes excess heat before cooling down in the canals and re-entering the system. The canals have provided abundant prey and elevated berms for nesting – but, most crucially, the absence of human interference. By 2007, the American Crocodile Distinct Population Segment in Florida was reclassified from Endangered to Threatened. 



The canals have long been suspected to have had serious problems, and in recent years, it has been confirmed that they are leaking salt water and contaminating the Biscayne Aquifer. 2012 marked a significant turning point: the very same year FPL stopped publishing crocodile monitoring data, they responded to pressure from environmental groups and addressed saltwater intrusion. In conducting an internal investigation, FPL published a plan to add water from the Floridan Aquifer to freshen the canals and dilute their saline content. The public acknowledgement of a longstanding issue prompted further investigation from both environmental groups and county legislators. One such example was a study published in the Miami Herald conducted by Miami-Dade County which reported tritium levels in Biscayne Bay up to 215 times higher than normal ocean water. Tritium is a radioactive isotope that is used for water tracingand, although these levels are still far below what the Clean Water Act accepts in drinking water, the presence of tritium led scientists to believe that water was leaking, and travelling with ammonia and phosphorus, into the bay.
