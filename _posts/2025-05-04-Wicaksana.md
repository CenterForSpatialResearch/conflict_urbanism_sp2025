#### **INTRODUCTION**

the long-standing paradigm that categorizes Southeast Asian cities as “Third World cities” with unique, non-Western features. Dick and Rimmer (1998) argue that due to globalisation and urban restructuring since the 1980s, Southeast Asian cities are increasingly converging with Western urban forms. Cities now feature edge cities, gated communities, mega-malls, and integrated satellite towns, especially around Jakarta. Jakarta exemplifies hybrid urban conditions, with new town developments reshaping the urban landscape into sprawling, privately developed zones integrating residential, commercial, and industrial functions, where informal settlements (kampung) are not peripheral but integral to the city’s form and function. This challenges the dominant urban theories focused on formal development and marginalization. Kampungs embody a “middle” position—both rural and urban, formal and informal, integrated yet marginalized.

Informal settlements or **kampungs** are home to 20–25% of Jakarta’s population and are often labeled “illegal” by authorities. Residents face both environmental threats (flooding, subsidence) and state-led displacement via “modernization” plans like river dredging and flood mitigation. The state simultaneously depends on and displaces kampung residents, using evictions and redevelopment as tools of control.

Jakarta's urban form is best understood not through binary oppositions but via the integrated, ambivalent space of the kampung—a site of survival, negotiation, and production within capitalist urbanization.

#### **Western Idea of urbanization**

Urban development in Jakarta increasingly reflects a globalized, Western-influenced mindset—one that prioritizes top-down planning, technological efficiency, and alignment with international standards of modernity. Initiatives such as the **Jakarta Smart City program** and the city’s aspiration to become a **global financial hub** are emblematic of this trend. They frame progress in terms of digital infrastructure, economic competitiveness, and investment appeal, often designed and delivered through elite-driven governance. 

A striking example of this mindset is the **Great Garuda project (NCICD)**—a Dutch-led mega-infrastructure plan that proposes to shield Jakarta from coastal flooding through a massive sea wall shaped like a mythical bird. Marketed as both a flood solution and a symbol of national advancement, the project also includes land reclamation and luxury development.

As Kian Goh notes in Form and Flow, the Great Garuda functions not only as engineering but as a **narrative of state-led modernization**—one that has been **heavily criticized for privileging elite interests, justifying kampung evictions, and excluding meaningful public participation.** 

Together, these initiatives illustrate how urban transformation in Jakarta often relies on a **Western logic of control and formalization,** where communities are expected to adapt to the plan, rather than shape it. To move toward a more equitable and inclusive city, development must shift from imposing visions from above to recognizing and engaging the urban knowledge that already exists on the ground.

#### **Tracing the history of Jakarta political dynamics**

Jakarta has long been more than just Indonesia’s capital—it has been a launchpad for political power. Over the past two decades, the role of governor has increasingly become a pathway to the presidency. In this context, large-scale urban development projects—flood mitigation, housing renewal, infrastructure upgrades, are often used not just to address urban challenges, but to perform leadership and gain national visibility.

![Timeline of Jakarta’s Political and Urban Development History (2007–2022)](/conflict_urbanism_sp2025/images/wicaksana/wonggom_Timeline.png)

From Sutiyoso and Fauzi Bowo to Jokowi, Ahok, and Anies Baswedan, each administration has introduced its own wave of mega-projects: river normalization, seawalls, smart city platforms, and expressways. While framed as solutions to pressing urban issues, these projects often reflect top-down decision-making shaped more by political ambition than by local needs. Jokowi’s rise, for example, was closely tied to his urban initiatives in Jakarta, many of which were continued or intensified by his successors.

Across these shifts, kampung communities have borne the cost. Evictions often rise during periods of political transition, revealing how Jakarta’s landscape is not only a site of planning, but of power. The ever-changing city reflects not just development pressures, but the ambitions of those who hope to rule it, and beyond.

#### **Case studies** 

##### **Kampung Pulo: Wiped out in the name of flood control**

Kampung Pulo was a dense riverside neighborhood in East Jakarta, situated along the Ciliwung River.  Despite ***being informal in the eyes of the state*** (many lacked formal land ownership), Kampung Pulo was **a well-organized, socially connected community and tight-knit social life** made it a place of belonging for working-class Jakartans.

In **August 2015**, the Jakarta provincial government under <u>Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) </u> carried out a ***large-scale forced eviction*** of Kampung Pulo residents.

The government claimed the eviction was necessary for:

1. Ciliwung River normalization (flood control and infrastructure improvements)
2. Creating a green corridor and embankment wall
3. Protecting Jakarta from annual flooding

Despite widespread protests, many residents were evicted with little warning or fair compensation. Hundreds of police and military officers were deployed. Heavy machinery moved in, demolishing homes while people were still packing their belongings.

##### **Kampung Karbela: Strategic Location = Daily Interaction**

Karet Kuningan, or Karbela, sits in the shadow of Jakarta’s Golden Triangle—one of Southeast Asia’s most important financial districts. Its presence highlights the strategic location of many kampungs, which have evolved alongside the city over time.

![Timelapse satellite images show the transformation of the financial district and Kampung Karbela.](/conflict_urbanism_sp2025/images/wicaksana/wonggom_Karbela_Aerialtimelapse_rev.gif)

The red overlay represents the officially recognized area of Kampung Karbela, while the yellow dashed boundary marks the edge between the kampung and the financial district, where commercial activity and interaction is concentrated.

Residents of Karbela operate a wide range of informal services that directly support workers in the financial district, illustrating the deep interconnection between kampung life and Jakarta’s formal economy. These residents provide essential, low-cost labor across various sectors, including:

1. Street food stalls and warungs that feed thousands of office workers each day.
2. Laundry and tailoring services catering to white-collar staff.
3. Parking management, motorbike taxis (ojek), delivery services, and domestic work for nearby executives.
4. Kampungs offer affordable housing in the city, housing a large portion of Jakarta's working-class population, despite overcrowding and poor infrastructure.

These services are not only affordable and flexible, but they also rely on hyper-local knowledge—making them vital to the smooth operation of Jakarta’s formal economy. Far from being separate, they are deeply interwoven into the systems that keep the city running.

<blockquote> "Their survival isn’t just about resistance, it’s about co-production of the city." </blockquote>

##### **Kampung Akuarium: Erased ,but rebuilt by resistance, the best approach to accommodating informality**

Kampungs Residents had lived in the area since the 1970s, forming a **tight-knit community with livelihoods tied to the nearby fish market** and informal economic activities.​ They  preserve cultural traditions, creating strong community networks and social support systems, while contributing to the city’s unique cultural identity in this fisherman community. 

![Timelapse satellite images of Kampung Akuarium transformation](/conflict_urbanism_sp2025/images/wicaksana/wonggom_Akuarium_Aerialtimelapse_rev.gif)

Like many kampungs Akuarium established near trade routes, water sources, or urban centers for economic and resource access. Over time, these locations became valuable real estate, and Kampungs remained in place as cities expanded. **On April 11, 2016, the Jakarta Provincial Government, under Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok). The eviction aimed to revitalize the Kota Tua heritage area and integrate the land into urban development projects.**

![Timelapse of Google Street View images shows transformation of the contested site where residents refused to relocate and stayed in makeshift shelters.](/conflict_urbanism_sp2025/images/wicaksana/wonggom_Akuarium_Humanscaletimelapse2.gif)

Following the eviction, many residents refused to relocate to temporary housing and instead **stayed in makeshift shelters on the demolished site. They organized protests, filed lawsuits, and garnered support from NGOs**. Which are another form of infrapolitic, daily tactics: rebuilding demolished homes, resisting registration to remain off radar, reclaiming public space. After Anies Baswedan's election victory, the government initiated the reconstruction of Kampung Akuarium as a "vertical kampung"—a mid-rise housing complex designed with community input.

<blockquote> “Warga beradaptasi dengan cara yang tidak terlihat, tapi sangat politis.” Kampung resistance ranges from visible protest to infrapolitical acts </blockquote>

#### **Conclusion and hopes for the future**

The story of Jakarta’s kampungs reveals a deeper imperative: **Southeast Asian cities must be reintegrated into global urban discourse not as passive recipients of Western planning models, but as producers of their own urban knowledge.** Too often, dominant frameworks prioritize formal infrastructure and top-down control, sidelining the lived realities of communities whose informal systems are deeply adaptive, resilient, and socially rich. Kampung residents do not reject development. They call for **in-situ upgrading, secure tenure,** and **hybrid spaces** that sustain social proximity and everyday livelihoods. As one resident put it, 

<blockquote> "Warga ingin kota yang bisa menampung hidup mereka, bukan mengusir mereka” —they want a city that can hold their lives, not push them out." </blockquote>

Researchers, activists, and design practitioners working in solidarity with these communities envision a different urban future—one that challenges narratives that criminalize informality and instead positions it as a site of innovation, care, and collective life. 

The kampung is not a remnant of the past but a **living alternative** to dominant urban paradigms. If global urban discourse is to respond meaningfully to the intertwined crises of inequality and climate change, it must shift from exporting solutions to **learning from situated practices.** In the kampung, we find not a problem to solve, but a set of propositions for how cities might be reimagined **just, adaptable, and rooted in the lives of those who build and sustain them every day.**
