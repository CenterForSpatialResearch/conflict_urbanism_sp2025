  <br><br> Artsakh, or Nagorno-Karabakh, is a region of the Caucasus that has been the site of particularly violent contestation between Armenian and Azerbaijani ethnolinguistic groups since the decline of the Soviet Union, first from 1988 to 1994 resulting in occupation of the historically majority-Christian and majority-Armenian-ethnolinguistic region by Azerbaijani military, then in 2020, with the subjugation of this population to governance by the Azerbaijani state, and finally, in 2023, with a state program of depopulation, including forced expulsion of over 120,000 Armenian residents and the coerced surrender of national identity of remaining residents.

  <br><br> Before focusing on “smart cities”, it is important to critically address how the tactics used by the Azerbaijani nation-state to consolidate control over this area closely parallel the Azerbaijani nation-building project. A tactic is the deployment of “ecological activists” to blockade the Lachin Corridor. Claiming to protest pollution and a vague risk of environmental exploitation, these “activists” prevented delivery of supplies or personnel to majority-Armenian areas. Nonetheless, in 2021, Azerbaijan intervened in the Qashgachay, Elbeydash, and Agduzdag ore deposits, subsequently selling land to Turkish mining companies. Here, too, one reads an underlying anxiety about Azerbaijani dependency upon a petroleum economy quickly falling out of vogue on an international stage.

  <br><br>In line with the Azerbaijani nationalist claims to the dual authorities of an ancient empire and a contemporary, technocratic futurism, “smart cities” have emerged as a 21st-century, greenwashed settler-colonial tactic. Variously described as “integrated with advanced technologies to enhance urban and rural living conditions” or simply surveillance state apparati, “smart cities” have been built throughout Azerbaijan, but most recently in “liberated” Karabakh as a means of consolidating control over the territory.

Although several developments throughout Artsakh/Nagorno-Karabakh have earned the designation of "Smart City," each site's claim to this title remains quite distinct from the others. A brief examination of the technologies deployed at six of these sites, and some of their accompanying social media celebrations, in fact reveals various threads of anxiety at the heart of contemporary nation-building.

Agali I, II, and III, are a collection of settlements in the Zengilan region and perhaps the most emblematic of the historical entanglements of all of the smart cities of the former Artsakh area.  

<br><br>

The city's impressive post-2020 construction with integrated "smart technologies" presents an interesting paradox for Azerbaijani state mythmaking. On one hand, the city is "new," built from the ground-up with 21st-century technologies, and yet, on the other hand, it must appear "old," so as to warrant its "liberation" from ethnic Armenians in the project of "the Great Return".  

<br><br>

President Aliyev's tweet announcing the city's "recapture" already hints at a certain awkardness, identifying Agali I, Agali II, and Agali III as "liberated" towns:
