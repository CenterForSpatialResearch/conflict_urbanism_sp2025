#### Introduction

The now simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated last September 2024, after almost a year of war between Israel and Hamas, has unearthed an uncomfortable reality around the disproportionate and long-lasting impacts of warfare. Civilians,  aid workers, and essential infrastructure have either been targeted or caught in the crossfire between the two actors, with the World Bank estimating a loss of US$8.5 billion in Lebanon due to physical damages and economic loss (World Bank, 2024). This project looks at what is missing in the equation of “proportionality”, specifically highlighting the long-term impacts such as 1. Loss of life, 2. Infrastructure damage, and 3. Loss of humanitarian aid and healthcare workers. This project aims to go deeper than recounting the number of attacks or fatalities, but to understand how the attacks may inflict long-term harm on communities. 

#### Attacks in Lebanon

</figure>

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has caused immeasurable damage on both sides of the border. An estimated 1.2 million people in Lebanon and 60,000 in northern Israel have been displaced since October 7th, 2023 (Al Jazeera, 2024), altering the DNA of the cities and towns across the region (Scott, 2012). Over 100,000 infrastructural assets in Lebanon (World Bank, 2024) and thousands of homes in northern Israel were damaged or destroyed (Reuters, 2024), eliminating vital spaces for economic and social interactions (Larkin, 2023).

Utilizing data from the ACLED, Aid Worker Security Database, Humanitarian Data Exchange, WHO, and others, this project looks at the effects of Israel's bombardment on Lebanon since October 7th, 2023, peaking in September 2024 and ending on December 31st, 2024, after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. Initially, this project endeavored to analyze all the ways in which society is altered by war and how that should be considered when applying the rule of "proportionality". 

However, many media outlets and research have explored the various impacts such as building damange, number of displaced people, and overall mortality rates-- so, instead, this project dives deeper into the experience of one city and how the war has altered local citizens' ability to access basic services and visualize the extent to which war can paralyze a society. At the same time, it celebrates the simultaneous continuation of life and urban living amid disaster and violence. 

#### Choropleth Map of Attack Intensity

Per international humanitarian law (IHL), proportional warfare assumes that “incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination” is not excessive relative to the military advantage won (ICRC, n.d..). However, “IHL provides no objective standard for assessing what constitutes excessive civilian harm in relation to a given military advantage” (Medecins Sans Frontieres, n.d.). If Hezbollah alleges that 500 of its fighters were killed in Israel’s offensive in Lebanon (Reuters, 2024), does this outweigh the death toll among civilians in Lebanon? Does it outweigh the reverberating effects of Lebanon’s real GDP growth, which fell by 6.6% this last year (World Bank, 2024)? Proportionality also doesn’t consider the type of civilians killed or infrastructure damaged. 

This chloropleth map portrays the density of fatalities in Lebanon between Oct. 7th, 2023, and Dec. 31st, 2024. Of the 2,922 civilian fatalities recorded by ACLED--and it's important to note that the Lebanese Health Mininstry doesn't distinguish between civilian and combatant but ACLED's dataset do-- 

* 2850 were killed by air/drone strike
* 10 were killed in land attacks
* 5 were killed by remote explosive or landmines
* 57 were killed in shellings



#### Focus: Sour Governorate

In Lebanon, there have been a total of 14,812 episodes of violence by the Israeli forced between Oct. 7th, 2023 and Dec. 31st, 2024. One of the governorates accounting for some of the highest number of attacks was Tyre (also spelled Tyr and Sour in some datasets). Tyre is located on the coast of Lebanon and is known as one of the oldest civilizations-- previously a Phoenician city with Roman ruins that still stand to this day. It is also known to be the birth place of the color purple which came from using sea snails (Ancient Color). Tyre is used as a case study because it was the center of much destruction, and also embodies a layer of antiquity that deems it almost fragile, while also standing as a reminder of urban durability.

#### Tyre Healthcare Impacted

If airstrikes kill humanitarian aid and healthcare workers or damage hospitals and clinics, is this added to the calculation of proportionality if people now can’t access vital services? And who will people turn to for their basic services if institutions are destroyed? A Reuter’s report in November 2024 stated that Hezbollah was handing out cash to people affected by the hostilities, including displaced people. Foreign policy theory would suggest the damages caused and the inability of the national government to respond leaves areas ripe for the exploitation of non-state armed groups, thus, perpetuating the very thing meant to be “rooted out” (Crisis Group, 2016).

Amid violent conflict, emergency response is vital, and yet, there have been 137 attacks on healthcare workers (WHO, 2024) and 16 attacks on humanitarian aid workers (AWSD, 2024) in Lebanon since October, which hinders the provision of life-saving care, even after the conflict is over. At the UN General Assembly in 2024, Netanyahu vowed, “We’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met” (AP, 2024), which begs the question: to what end?

## Reflections

Mapping the human consequences of conflict requires both spatial precision and narrative

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism, Spring 2025 you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:  

![description of image](/template_site/images/sample_image.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
