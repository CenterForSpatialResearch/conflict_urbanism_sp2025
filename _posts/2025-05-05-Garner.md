#### Introduction

The now simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated last September 2024, after almost a year of war between Israel and Hamas, has unearthed an uncomfortable reality around the disproportionate and long-lasting impacts of warfare. Civilians,  aid workers, and essential infrastructure have either been targeted or caught in the crossfire between the two actors, with the World Bank estimating a loss of US$8.5 billion in Lebanon due to physical damages and economic loss (World Bank, 2024). This project looks at what is missing in the equation of “proportionality”, specifically highlighting the long-term impacts such as 1. Loss of life, 2. Infrastructure damage, and 3. Loss of humanitarian aid and healthcare workers. This project aims to go deeper than recounting the number of attacks or fatalities, but to understand how the attacks may inflict long-term harm on communities. 

#### Attacks in Lebanon

</figure>

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has caused immeasurable damage on both sides of the border. An estimated 1.2 million people in Lebanon and 60,000 in northern Israel have been displaced since October 7th, 2023 (Al Jazeera, 2024), altering the DNA of the cities and towns across the region (Scott, 2012). Over 100,000 infrastructural assets in Lebanon (World Bank, 2024) and thousands of homes in northern Israel were damaged or destroyed (Reuters, 2024), eliminating vital spaces for economic and social interactions (Larkin, 2023).

Utilizing data from the ACLED, Aid Worker Security Database, Humanitarian Data Exchange, WHO, and others, this project looks at the effects of Israel's bombardment on Lebanon since October 7th, 2023, peaking in September 2024 and ending on December 31st, 2024, after the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanon. Initially, this project endeavored to analyze all the ways in which society is altered by war and how that should be considered when applying the rule of "proportionality". 

However, many media outlets and research have already explored the various impacts such as building damange, number of displaced people, and overall mortality rates-- so, instead, this project dives deeper into the experience of one city and how the war has altered local citizens' ability to access basic services and visualize the extent to which war can paralyze a society. At the same time, it celebrates the simultaneous continuation of life and urban goings-on amid disaster and violence. 

#### Proportionality and Loss of Life

</figure>

Per international humanitarian law (IHL), proportional warfare assumes that “incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination” is not excessive relative to the military advantage won (ICRC, n.d..). However, “IHL provides no objective standard for assessing what constitutes excessive civilian harm in relation to a given military advantage” (Medecins Sans Frontieres, n.d.). If Hezbollah alleges that 500 of its fighters were killed in Israel’s offensive in Lebanon (Reuters, 2024), does this outweigh the death toll among civilians in Lebanon? Does it outweigh the reverberating effects of Lebanon’s real GDP growth, which fell by 6.6% this last year (World Bank, 2024)? 

This chloropleth map portrays the density of fatalities in Lebanon between Oct. 7th, 2023, and Dec. 31st, 2024. There were 4,751 total fatalities that occurred in Lebanon by Israeli militants. Of the 4,751 fatalities, 2,922 were civilians-- although it's important to note that the Lebanese Health Mininstry doesn't distinguish between civilian and combatant but ACLED's dataset does. The deaths are catagorized as the following... 

* 2850 were killed by air/drone strike
* 10 were killed in land attacks
* 5 were killed by remote explosive or landmines
* 57 were killed in shellings

The death of over 4,000 people distinctly changes the fabric of society and armed conflict, in general, reveals cross-sectoral development gaps that lead to lasting impacts (Vesco, et. al., 2025). With majority of attacks occurring by drone strike, the next step in the analysis was looking at how the strikes affect life beyond the fatalities. 

#### Zooming in on the Every Day Impacts

Between October 7, 2023, and December 31, 2024, Lebanon experienced a total of 14,812 incidents of violence carried out by Israeli forces. Among the areas most heavily impacted was the governorate of Tyre—also spelled Tyr or Sour in various datasets. Located along Lebanon’s southern coast, Tyre is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. Once a thriving Phoenician city, it is home to Roman ruins that still stand today, and it is historically credited as the birthplace of the color purple, derived from sea snail pigments (Ancient Color).

Tyre endured over 4,211 attacks during this period, resulting in 661 recorded fatalities. The governorate was selected as a case study not only because of the scale of destruction it endured, but also because it represents a unique duality: its archaeological and cultural fragility, juxtaposed against its urban resilience in the face of repeated conflict.

The accompanying map visualizes the concentration of Israeli attacks overlaid with the locations of essential public infrastructure—including healthcare facilities, schools, water sources, and energy nodes. This spatial relationship reveals that violence was not evenly distributed, but rather clustered in areas critical to civilian survival and community functioning. The damage to these networks extends the impact of war beyond immediate casualties, disrupting access to services for tens of thousands of residents. It suggests that proportionality in conflict must not only account for the number of lives lost, but also the sustained deprivation of basic human needs that follows in the wake of repeated attacks on vital infrastructure.

#### Tyre Healthcare Impacted

The principle of proportionality in warfare is often narrowly interpreted as a ratio between military advantage and civilian harm. But what happens when the civilians affected are humanitarian aid workers or doctors, and the infrastructure destroyed includes clinics and hospitals? Does proportionality account for the compounding effects of destroying life-sustaining institutions? When healthcare facilities are bombed and aid convoys targeted, it’s not only immediate casualties that must be counted—but also the lives at risk due to the loss of access to essential services in the days, weeks, and months that follow. And in the absence of functioning institutions, who will communities turn to for survival?

Since October 2023, Lebanon has recorded 137 attacks on healthcare personnel and infrastructure (WHO, 2024) and 16 attacks on humanitarian aid workers (AWSD, 2024). These assaults not only disrupt emergency response during conflict, but also undermine post-conflict recovery and long-term health outcomes. The effects ripple through the system—especially in underserved areas like southern Lebanon, where service coverage was already fragile.

At the UN General Assembly in 2024, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared, “We’ll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met” (AP, 2024). This raises a critical question: to what end? And at what cost to Lebanon’s civilian population?

Zooming in a little closer to the city of Tyre, this map demonstrates Israeli attacks relative to basic services and roads. The red explosion symbols represent confirmed Israeli strikes, while blue crosses denote healthcare facilities and social service points. Major road networks and urban boundaries are overlaid for reference. This map makes visible the dense clustering of attacks around vital civilian infrastructure. Clinics, pharmacies, hospitals, and diagnostic centers are all within proximity of strike zones—posing an existential threat to those already vulnerable.

## Reflections

Mapping the human consequences of conflict requires both spatial precision and narrative

To present and turn in your final projects for Conflict Urbanism, Spring 2025 you will be editing this template. You will include all of the text of your paper here, along with any and all images, maps, videos, or other materials that you produce.  

[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.  

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions  
(make sure to put two spaces after the end of the heading)

Write **words in bold** like this.  

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.  

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.  

See this is now a new paragraph.  

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.  

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).  

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:  

![description of image](/template_site/images/sample_image.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>  

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:  

<div class="iframe-column"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
